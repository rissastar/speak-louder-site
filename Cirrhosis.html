  <h2>Cirrhosis Awareness & Advocacy</h2>
  <p>
    Cirrhosis is a late-stage liver disease marked by scarring (fibrosis) of the liver. It happens after long-term, continuous damage to the liver and may be caused by many different liver diseases and conditions, such as hepatitis and chronic alcohol use.
  </p>

  <h3>My Journey</h3>
  <p>
    Living with cirrhosis alongside cystic fibrosis has been overwhelming. There are days where I’ve felt like my body was giving up on me—but I’ve learned to fight for my health and speak up for what I need. My journey has included countless hospital visits, pain, frustration, and hard choices. But it has also been filled with strength, growth, and moments of clarity. No one should feel alone dealing with this disease.
