    <h1>Addiction Awareness</h1>

      “Addiction isn’t a choice—it’s a response to pain. But healing is possible.”

      <h2>What is Addiction?</h2>
      <p>
        Addiction is not weakness. It’s not just about substances—it’s about trauma, mental health, pain, and trying to cope when life feels unlivable. For me, it started after moving away from home at 16. I was lost, sick, and searching for something to help me feel okay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it’s drugs, alcohol, or anything else—we don’t choose addiction. But we can choose to heal.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>My Story with Addiction</h2>
      <p>
        I didn’t stumble into addiction by accident. I was born into it. Addiction isn’t just part of my past—it’s been part of my whole life. My mom was an addict. So was my dad. Before I even understood what drugs or alcohol were, I knew what it felt like to be a kid who came second to them. I knew the emptiness of waiting for someone who doesn’t show up, the chaos of promises that mean nothing, and the ache of wanting your parents to just <em>be better</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Growing up like that changes you. You learn to be tough before you should. You learn to keep secrets. You learn not to expect much from the people who are supposed to protect you. And somewhere in all that, you learn to cope however you can. That’s how I ended up following the same path. Addiction didn’t feel like a choice—it felt like something I’d already been handed.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also fell in love with someone who became addicted—someone I really cared about. Watching them slowly slip into addiction was like watching someone drown in slow motion. At first, I didn’t even see it happening. Then the lies started. The mood swings. The broken promises. The person I loved started fading away, and someone I didn’t recognize took their place. That kind of grief is hard to explain—it’s not just about losing them. It’s about still seeing them, but knowing they’re not <em>there</em> anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        I tried to help. I tried everything. But you can’t love someone out of addiction. You can’t fight their battle for them. And eventually, you have to ask yourself: <strong>How much of myself am I willing to lose trying to save someone who doesn’t want to be saved yet?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I still carry all of it with me. The pain. The lessons. The love. I still love my mom, even though her addiction hurt me deeply. I still wonder what life could have been if things were different. I still have days where I miss the person I loved before addiction changed them. But I’ve learned to love from a distance when I have to. I’ve learned to protect my peace, even when it hurts.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I’ve learned that addiction doesn’t define me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, I’ve been the daughter of addicts. Yes, I became one myself. Yes, I’ve loved someone who was drowning in it. But I’ve also survived it. I’ve come out the other side more awake, more honest, and more determined to speak out.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re reading this and you’ve lived through addiction—whether it’s yours or someone else’s—I see you. I know how heavy it gets. But I also know you’re not alone, and your story isn’t over.

      <h2>How to Help Someone Struggling</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Be patient. Recovery is never a straight line.</li>
        <li>Don’t shame them. Addiction is already full of guilt.</li>
        <li>Listen more than you speak. Just being there can be everything.</li>
        <li>Offer resources, not ultimatums.</li>
        <li>Take care of yourself too—supporting someone in addiction is heavy.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Help for Yourself</h2>
      <p>
        If you're reading this and you’re struggling, please hear me: You’re not alone. You don’t need to hit rock bottom to reach out. Asking for help is strength. It saved my life—and it can save yours too.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can start over. You are worth the fight.
