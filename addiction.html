      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>
        I never expected addiction to become part of my story, but it did. When I moved to Alberta at 16, I was already dealing with trauma, instability, and the need to escape. I found myself in a world where drugs and alcohol felt like the only way to cope. What started off as a way to numb the pain turned into a daily struggle I couldn’t escape.
      </p>
      <p>
        Addiction made me feel like I lost myself. I pushed away people who cared, I let go of things I once loved, and I ended up sicker than I had ever been. My body was shutting down, and my mental health was breaking apart. I was so sick I had to return to Nova Scotia, not just to detox, but to survive. While I was fighting for my life, my mom had a baby who ended up being adopted out in Alberta. Everything was falling apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recovery didn’t happen overnight. I had to face the reasons I was using. I had to relearn how to feel and how to live. I had to forgive myself for the things I did when I was hurting. Addiction stole a lot from me—but it didn’t take everything. I’m still here. I’m still healing. And I’m using my story to raise awareness and fight the stigma.
