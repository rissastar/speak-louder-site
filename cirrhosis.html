    <h2>What is Cirrhosis?</h2>
<p>
    Cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease characterized by the replacement of healthy liver tissue with scar tissue. This scarring disrupts the liver‚Äôs normal structure and function, impairing its ability to process nutrients, hormones, drugs, and toxins, as well as produce proteins and clotting factors. Cirrhosis develops over many years, often as a result of long-term liver damage caused by conditions such as chronic alcohol use, viral hepatitis, or fatty liver disease. If left untreated, cirrhosis can lead to liver failure and other serious complications.
</p>
    <h3>Common Causes of Cirrhosis</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Chronic hepatitis B or C</li>
      <li>Fatty liver disease (including non-alcoholic fatty liver)</li>
      <li>Alcohol-related liver damage</li>
      <li>Genetic diseases like Cystic Fibrosis or Wilson‚Äôs disease</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Symptoms of Cirrhosis</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fatigue and weakness</li>
    <li>Loss of appetite and weight loss</li>
    <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
    <li>Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)</li>
    <li>Swelling in the legs, feet, or abdomen (edema and ascites)</li>
    <li>Itchy skin</li>
    <li>Easy bruising and bleeding</li>
    <li>Spider-like blood vessels on the skin (spider angiomas)</li>
    <li>Red palms (palmar erythema)</li>
    <li>Confusion, difficulty concentrating, or memory problems (hepatic encephalopathy)</li>
    <li>Dark urine and pale stools</li>
    <li>Enlarged spleen</li>
</ul>
<h2>Treatments for Cirrhosis</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Lifestyle changes:</strong> Avoid alcohol, maintain a healthy diet, and manage weight.</li>
    <li><strong>Medications:</strong> To control symptoms and complications such as diuretics for fluid buildup, beta-blockers to reduce portal hypertension, and antibiotics to prevent infections.</li>
    <li><strong>Procedures:</strong> Paracentesis (fluid drainage), banding or sclerotherapy to stop bleeding from varices, and TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) to reduce portal vein pressure.</li>
    <li><strong>Treating underlying causes:</strong> Antiviral drugs for hepatitis, managing fatty liver disease, or stopping harmful medications.</li>
    <li><strong>Liver transplant:</strong> In severe cases where liver failure occurs, a transplant may be necessary.</li>
    <li><strong>Regular monitoring:</strong> Frequent check-ups and tests to manage complications early.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Facts About Cirrhosis</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cirrhosis is the result of long-term liver damage causing scar tissue to replace healthy liver tissue.</li>
  <li>Common causes include chronic alcohol use, viral hepatitis, and fatty liver disease.</li>
  <li>Early cirrhosis may not show symptoms, making it hard to detect until it‚Äôs advanced.</li>
  <li>Complications include liver failure, portal hypertension, variceal bleeding, and hepatic encephalopathy.</li>
  <li>Liver transplant is the only cure for end-stage cirrhosis.</li>
  <li>Healthy lifestyle changes and treating underlying causes can slow progression.</li>
  <li>Regular medical monitoring is essential for managing symptoms and complications.</li>
</ul>
<h1>My Experience with Cirrhosis</h1>

    <p>
        I was about 17 years old when I was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis, but my journey started years before that. For a long time, I knew something was wrong with my liver‚ÄîI felt constant pain and discomfort, but every time I told doctors, they dismissed me because I was ‚Äútoo young‚Äù to have liver problems. What‚Äôs even more frustrating is that the scarring in my liver was visible on scans two years before my diagnosis, but nobody acted on it or warned me. It felt like my pain and concerns didn‚Äôt matter.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I remember the day I was finally told I had cirrhosis like it was yesterday. I was sitting in the hospital, anxious and confused, when the doctor came in and said my entire liver was scarred. Hearing that knocked the wind out of me. At 17, that‚Äôs a lot to process‚Äîyour liver, an organ you barely think about, is seriously damaged. I didn‚Äôt know whether to cry, be angry, or just numb out. It was overwhelming.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        From there, the symptoms and complications took over my life. Jaundice turned my skin and eyes a yellow-orange hue, making me look sick in a way everyone noticed. I developed ascites‚Äîfluid buildup in my belly that made me look pregnant and caused intense discomfort and shortness of breath. I also had edema, swelling in my legs and feet, making it painful to walk or stand.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I had to go through multiple paracentesis procedures‚Äîtaps to drain the fluid from my abdomen‚Äîbecause the swelling would come back constantly. The discomfort and pressure were relentless. Then came the TIPS procedure, a shunt put into my liver to redirect blood flow and reduce pressure in my veins. That was a scary and complicated surgery but it helped stabilize things for a while.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Blood loss became a terrifying part of my life. I lost over half of my blood internally from varices‚Äîdilated veins in my esophagus prone to rupture. I had to get about nine blood transfusions over two years just to stay alive. The doctors had to band these veins multiple times to stop the bleeding. Each episode felt like I was walking on a tightrope between life and death.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        One of the scariest complications I faced was hepatic encephalopathy. This condition affects your brain because the liver can‚Äôt clear toxins properly. My episodes ranged from minor confusion to severe brain dysfunction where I was almost in a coma. I don‚Äôt remember those worst moments, but my family does‚Äîthey were told I was likely going to die. That fear and uncertainty are hard to describe.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        That experience made me appreciate life so much more. Every day feels like a gift because I‚Äôve come so close to losing it. But it also left a lasting impact‚Äîafter that really bad episode, I feel like my head isn‚Äôt all there sometimes. My memory and thinking aren‚Äôt as sharp as they used to be, and that‚Äôs a tough adjustment.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Cirrhosis affected every part of my life‚Äîphysically, emotionally, and mentally. Before the shunt, I was in constant pain and fear. Now, while the shunt has improved my condition, I still deal with symptoms like jaundice, ascites, edema, and occasional hepatic encephalopathy episodes. My palms remain permanently red‚Äîa visible reminder of the damage inside.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Living with cirrhosis is exhausting and frustrating. It‚Äôs not just a physical battle but a mental one too. Managing symptoms, hospital visits, procedures, and the uncertainty of what might come next takes a toll. But I keep pushing forward. It‚Äôs not easy, but I‚Äôm still here, fighting and hoping for better days.
    </p>

    <h3>What Helps</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Low-sodium diet and good hydration</li>
      <li>Regular bloodwork and liver scans</li>
      <li>Managing medications carefully</li>
      <li>Prioritizing rest, mental health, and support</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Don‚Äôt assume you know someone‚Äôs story by looking at them. Chronic illness is full of ups and downs, good days and hard ones. But there‚Äôs still light, still strength, still life. üíú</p>
