      <h2>What is Cirrhosis?</h2>
      <p>
        Cirrhosis is the severe scarring of the liver caused by long-term liver damage. It can result from chronic diseases such as hepatitis, alcohol abuse, and genetic conditions—but it also affects people with no clear risk factors. Cirrhosis impairs your liver's ability to function and leads to serious complications that can be life-threatening.

      <h2>My Experience with Cirrhosis</h2>
      <p>
        I was about 17 years old when I was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis, but my journey started years before that. For a long time, I knew something was wrong with my liver—I felt constant pain and discomfort, but every time I told doctors, they dismissed me because I was “too young” to have liver problems. What’s even more frustrating is that the scarring in my liver was visible on scans two years before my diagnosis, but nobody acted on it or warned me. It felt like my pain and concerns didn’t matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember the day I was finally told I had cirrhosis like it was yesterday. I was sitting in the hospital, anxious and confused, when the doctor came in and said my entire liver was scarred. Hearing that knocked the wind out of me. At 17, that’s a lot to process—your liver, an organ you barely think about, is seriously damaged. I didn’t know whether to cry, be angry, or just numb out. It was overwhelming.
      </p>
      <p>
        From there, the symptoms and complications took over my life. Jaundice turned my skin and eyes a yellow-orange hue, making me look sick in a way everyone noticed. I developed ascites—fluid buildup in my belly that made me look pregnant and caused intense discomfort and shortness of breath. I also had edema, swelling in my legs and feet, making it painful to walk or stand.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had to go through multiple paracentesis procedures—taps to drain the fluid from my abdomen—because the swelling would come back constantly. The discomfort and pressure were relentless. Then came the TIPS procedure, a shunt put into my liver to redirect blood flow and reduce pressure in my veins. That was a scary and complicated surgery but it helped stabilize things for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blood loss became a terrifying part of my life. I lost over half of my blood internally from varices—dilated veins in my esophagus prone to rupture. I had to get about nine blood transfusions over two years just to stay alive. The doctors had to band these veins multiple times to stop the bleeding. Each episode felt like I was walking on a tightrope between life and death.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the scariest complications I faced was hepatic encephalopathy. This condition affects your brain because the liver can’t clear toxins properly. My episodes ranged from minor confusion to severe brain dysfunction where I was almost in a coma. I don’t remember those worst moments, but my family does—they were told I was likely going to die. That fear and uncertainty are hard to describe.
      </p>
      <p>
        That experience made me appreciate life so much more. Every day feels like a gift because I’ve come so close to losing it. But it also left a lasting impact—after that really bad episode, I feel like my head isn’t all there sometimes. My memory and thinking aren’t as sharp as they used to be, and that’s a tough adjustment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cirrhosis affected every part of my life—physically, emotionally, and mentally. Before the shunt, I was in constant pain and fear. Now, while the shunt has improved my condition, I still deal with symptoms like jaundice, ascites, edema, and occasional hepatic encephalopathy episodes. My palms remain permanently red—a visible reminder of the damage inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        Living with cirrhosis is exhausting and frustrating. It’s not just a physical battle but a mental one too. Managing symptoms, hospital visits, procedures, and the uncertainty of what might come next takes a toll. But I keep pushing forward. It’s not easy, but I’m still here, fighting and hoping for better days.
