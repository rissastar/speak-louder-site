  <h2>My Story – By Larissa</h2>
  <p>When I was a kid, before me and my brother got taken away, we used to go to the neighbors’ house all the time. It was like the go-to place for all the neighborhood kids. They didn’t have kids of their own, but they had everything we didn’t — Wi-Fi, five computers, a big pool, dogs, and a huge house. It was like a dream spot for kids. They’d let us sleep over, bought us Christmas presents and a phone, took us on trips, and helped my mom with money and things. She was friends with them. So were a lot of other people. To a kid, it felt like these people were a blessing. But something always felt off to me.</p>

  <p>The man would always ask the girls to sit on his lap. One time, after swimming in their pool, he told me and my friend to “put our clothes back on.” We were just wearing swimsuits. It felt weird — wrong. But as a kid, I didn’t know how to label that feeling. I just knew I didn’t like it.</p>

  <p>We stayed overnight there a lot. They had a room they called “the blue room” for us kids — bunk beds, a TV, all set up like it was meant for sleepovers. But they also had cameras set up around the house. They made moonshine in the basement. It started off fun, but then they had us doing chores, like we owed them something. They gave us things our mom couldn’t afford, and it felt like we were supposed to pay them back somehow. It was like they were grooming us.</p>

  <p>Me and my brother went with them to Ontario together once. Then we both went to Vancouver — just not at the same time. When I went to Vancouver with them, that’s when something happened that changed everything.</p>

  <p>I was in the hotel pool, and the woman looked at me and said something I’ll never forget:  
  <strong>“Why don’t you go down the slide with him and sit on his lap so he’ll get hard?”</strong></p>

  <p>I froze. I didn’t know what to say. I dunked my head under the water and stayed there because I didn’t know what else to do. I felt scared. I didn’t understand why she’d say something like that. I didn’t end up going down the slide with him.</p>

  <p>Later, in the hotel shower, I felt paranoid. I kept looking around, thinking there might be a camera. I was just waiting for something bad to happen.</p>

  <p>Then that night — I don’t know how to explain it. I always told myself it was “just a dream,” but it didn’t feel like one. I remember feeling his weight on me. I remember the smell of his breath. I couldn’t move, couldn’t open my eyes, couldn’t scream. I felt like I was suffocating. It was like my body was frozen, and I couldn’t get away. Something deep down tells me it wasn’t a dream. My therapist even said it sounded like I could have been drugged.</p>

  <p>When we got home, I tried to tell my mom what the woman said at the pool. She didn’t believe me. She made me <strong>apologize</strong> to that woman. Then she sent me and my brother back to their house to finish the chores we “owed” them. I didn’t want to go. I fought. I cried. I begged her not to make me go. But she didn’t listen. She didn’t come with us either — just sent us off alone. We did what we had to do, and I never went back there again.</p>

  <p>But my <strong>Nan</strong>, she believed me. I told her what the woman had said, and she called the cops right away. I talked to them about that part, but I didn’t tell them the rest. I didn’t know how to. I didn’t tell anyone else until I was a teenager. I guess I was scared people wouldn’t believe me, or they’d think I was lying. Or maybe it was because I didn’t even fully know myself what happened. But my body remembered.</p>

  <p>When I was 14 and in therapy (because we got taken from my mom), I told the therapist about the dream — or whatever it was. Not all the details, just that it kept replaying in my head. And sometimes, when I’d smell something similar to his breath, I’d get flashbacks — like it was all happening again. My therapist said it was a red flag and had me talk to the police again. I did. But nothing came of it.</p>

  <p>There were other red flags too. One night before all the Vancouver stuff, my mom was at their house playing cards with them. I remember crying because my bum was burning so bad I couldn’t sit down. I didn’t know why. Another time, after sleeping there, I went home and used the bathroom and saw <strong>a lot</strong> of blood on the toilet paper. I was too young to have a period. I thought I was dying. I told my brother because I was scared, and we went to the neighbor’s house to tell the woman — because my mom wasn’t home. Now that I look back, I don’t think it was innocent.</p>

  <p>Looking back now, I think he raped me. And I don’t think it was just once. I worry about what might’ve happened to my brother. To my sister. I don’t have all the answers, but I know what I felt. I know what I remember. And I know how scared I was.</p>

  <p>For years, I carried this on my own. I stayed silent because no one believed me when I did speak. But I won’t be silent anymore.</p>

  <p>I’m telling my story — for me, for the little girl who was scared and silenced, and for anyone else out there who feels like they’re alone in this.</p>

  <h2>A Different Story — When I Lived in Dartmouth</h2>
  <p>When I was younger and living in Dartmouth, there was this boy I had a crush on — someone I was pretty close with. One day, he had a friend over, and me and my friend were there too. We were all hanging out in his bed, and me and my friend started kissing. But then his friend began touching me in ways that made me really uncomfortable. He kept putting his hands inside my pants, and even though I kept pulling them away and telling him to stop, he didn’t listen at first. I felt nervous and scared. I just wanted it to end. After a few times, it finally stopped and I left.</p>
  <p>There was another time, at a different guy’s house — someone else I liked. He also had a friend over, and the same thing happened with the friend. But this time, the guy I liked stopped his friend and made it stop. It was the only reason it ended.</p>
  <p>Both times left me feeling uneasy and confused. I didn’t like how I was treated, and it took me a while to understand that what happened wasn’t okay. But even back then, I knew I deserved better.</p>
