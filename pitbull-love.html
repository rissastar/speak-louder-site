      <h2>My Story with Zayah</h2>
      <p>
        Zayah isn’t just my dog—she’s my family, my comfort, my reason to smile when everything feels like too much. She's a one-year-old Pitbull with the biggest heart and the gentlest soul. She’s helped me through some of my darkest days, just by being by my side.
      </p>
      <p>
        When people hear "Pitbull," they often jump to conclusions. Aggressive. Dangerous. Unpredictable. But when people meet Zayah, they see the truth. She's sweet, loyal, cuddly, and full of love. She doesn't fit the stereotype—and the truth is, most Pitbulls don't.
      </p>
      <p>
        Advocating for Zayah also means advocating for every misunderstood dog out there. Pitbulls don’t need to be feared—they need to be loved and protected from the hate that humans created around them.
