  <h2>Domestic Violence & Women’s Abuse</h2>

  <blockquote>“Sometimes the ones we love the most are the ones who hurt us the worst.”</blockquote>

  <p>
    Domestic violence is more than physical—it’s emotional, psychological, verbal, and financial. It traps people in cycles of fear and control, often silently. My story, like so many others, is painful to tell but necessary to share.
  </p>

  <h3>My Story</h3>
  <p>
    (Names have been changed for privacy.)
  <h2>The Truth Behind My Smile</h2>
  <p>People see the survivor in me — but they rarely know the full story. They don’t know how many times I was almost another missing girl. They don’t know how many times I hid the bruises — physical and emotional — behind silence.</p>
  <p>This isn’t just a story about men who hurt me. This is about <strong>how I survived</strong> them.</p>

  <h3>Damon – The One Who Grew Up Like I Did</h3>
  <p>Damon and I were trauma-bonded long before we even knew what that meant. We met young — both of us products of broken homes, addiction, and survival. Our connection was deep and real... but also toxic.</p>
  <p>He loved me. I know he did. And I loved him. But love doesn’t always mean safe.</p>
  <p>He yelled, shoved, controlled, and emotionally manipulated me. Sometimes, it felt like walking through landmines just to talk. But I also saw the broken boy in him — the one no one protected. I related to that pain. I still do.</p>
  <p>We’ve been on and off for years. Still talk. Still check in. Both of us trying to do better — even if we’re still figuring out what “better” means. It’s messy. It’s complicated. But I’m not going to pretend the love wasn’t real, or that the damage wasn’t done.</p>

  <h3>Sean – The Night I Thought I'd Die</h3>
  <p>I didn’t even date Sean. We had talked a few times and hung out. I agreed to meet him at a hotel — just a date. I had no reason to think I was walking into danger.</p>
  <p>But that night… I saw something in him I’ll never forget.</p>
  <p>He snapped. One minute we were in the room, the next he was on me. There was no buildup — just a sudden, terrifying shift. I was frozen. I couldn't scream. I couldn’t move. All I could do was survive.</p>
  <p>I honestly thought <strong>he was going to kill me</strong>.</p>
  <p>And when it was over? He acted like nothing happened. But I know what happened. I could’ve been another news headline — and no one would’ve known the truth.</p>

  <h3>Jayden – The Betrayal I Didn’t See Coming</h3>
  <p>Jayden didn’t hit me. But he still left scars.</p>
  <p>I thought he was different. But when things got hard — when I needed him the most — he disappeared. He let others twist my story. He stayed silent when I needed someone to say, “I believe her.”</p>
  <p>That kind of betrayal doesn’t leave bruises. But it leaves you doubting your worth. And that kind of healing takes time.</p>

  <h3>The Month I Thought I'd Vanish – New Brunswick</h3>
  <p>I was 18 and had nowhere to go. I left with a man in his 30s and went to New Brunswick. I didn’t really trust him — but at that point, I didn’t care what happened to me.</p>
  <p>He relapsed almost immediately and started using a drug called “jib.” Everyone around us was high and paranoid. I remember hiding in a locked room. One man beat his girlfriend with a beer cooler — she was black and blue. No one helped her.</p>
  <p>The man I was with said terrifying things — like how he tied people up and left them in the woods. Then one day, he <strong>punched me in the face</strong> during an argument.</p>
  <p>I knew I had to escape. When he was gone one day, I messaged my mom. She told me to leave — and leave now.</p>
  <p>As I was leaving, he came home and chased me down the road. I ran for my life until a man we met the night before stopped his four-wheeler and told me to get on. He took me home and protected me until I could get on a bus two days later.</p>

  <h3>I’m Still Healing</h3>
  <p>I’ve survived things I don’t always talk about. I’ve made it out of rooms I thought I’d die in. I’ve been loved wrong. Left behind. Beaten down and blamed.</p>
  <p>But I’m still here.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Still breathing.</li>
    <li>Still standing.</li>
    <li><strong>Still rising.</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>This story isn’t just mine. It belongs to every woman who’s been told she was crazy, dramatic, or lying. To every girl who stayed too long, ran too late, or never made it out at all.</p>
