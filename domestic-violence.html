  <h2>Domestic Violence & Women’s Abuse</h2>

  <blockquote>“Sometimes the ones we love the most are the ones who hurt us the worst.”</blockquote>

  <p>
    Domestic violence is more than physical—it’s emotional, psychological, verbal, and financial. It traps people in cycles of fear and control, often silently. My story, like so many others, is painful to tell but necessary to share.
  </p>

  <h3>My Story</h3>
  <p>
    (Names have been changed for privacy.)
  <h2>The Truth Behind My Smile</h2>
  <p>People see the survivor in me — but they rarely know the full story. They don’t know how many times I was almost another missing girl. They don’t know how many times I hid the bruises — physical and emotional — behind silence.</p>
  <p>This isn’t just a story about men who hurt me. This is about <strong>how I survived</strong> them.</p>

  <h3>The Month I Thought I'd Vanish – New Brunswick</h3>
  <p>I was 18 and had nowhere to go. I left with a man in his 30s and went to New Brunswick. I didn’t really trust him — but at that point, I didn’t care what happened to me.</p>
  <p>He relapsed almost immediately and started using a drug called “jib.” Everyone around us was high and paranoid. I remember hiding in a locked room. One man beat his girlfriend with a beer cooler — she was black and blue. No one helped her.</p>
  <p>The man I was with said terrifying things — like how he tied people up and left them in the woods. Then one day, he <strong>punched me in the face</strong> during an argument.</p>
  <p>I knew I had to escape. When he was gone one day, I messaged my mom. She told me to leave — and leave now.</p>
  <p>As I was leaving, he came home and chased me down the road. I ran for my life until a man we met the night before stopped his four-wheeler and told me to get on. He took me home and protected me until I could get on a bus two days later.</p>

    <summary><strong>My Story</strong></summary>
    <p>
      My relationship with Logan was complicated. It’s hard to explain to people who haven’t lived it, but there was love—and there was pain. It wasn’t all bad, and that’s part of what made it so hard to walk away. Because when it was good, it felt <em>real</em>. And when it was bad… it broke me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Logan is broken in his own ways. I can see that now. He’s been through things that changed him, hurt him, twisted the way he sees love and control. That doesn’t excuse what he did to me—but it explains some of it. And maybe that’s why I kept going back—because part of me wanted to fix him. Part of me thought I could love him enough to make him whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      But love doesn’t work like that. And pain doesn’t heal when it keeps being repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      What we had wasn’t just a relationship—it was a trauma bond. A cycle of intensity, abuse, guilt, and apology. I wasn’t isolated from the world, but I was emotionally trapped. Stuck in a loop where I confused chaos with passion, and survival with love. Where my nervous system was so used to the highs and lows that peace felt like something foreign.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could be sweet. He could make me laugh. He knew how to say all the right things. But he also knew how to hurt me—and he did. Over and over. The worst part? I still cared. I still saw the version of him that I wished was the truth all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking away from that kind of bond isn’t just about leaving the person. It’s about breaking an addiction. It’s grieving something that never actually existed the way you thought it did. And it’s learning to love yourself in all the ways they didn’t.
    </p>
    <p>
      Logan isn’t all evil. He’s just not safe for me. And maybe he’ll change one day—but that’s not my responsibility anymore. My responsibility is me.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're reading this and you feel stuck in something that hurts but feels impossible to let go of—please know that what you're feeling is valid. Trauma bonds are real. They mess with your mind and heart. But you are <em>not crazy</em>. And you are not alone. Healing is messy, but it’s worth it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You don’t have to stay in pain just because you got used to it. You deserve better—even if you don’t fully believe that yet. I didn’t either, at first.

    <summary><strong>My Story with Ethan</strong></summary>
    <p>
      The night at the hotel with Ethan is something I’ll never forget — and it changed my life forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hadn’t officially dated. We only talked about it. But that night, everything turned dark and terrifying. What started as a conversation quickly became a nightmare. Ethan’s anger exploded, and he physically attacked me. He hit me so hard I ended up with two black eyes. I honestly thought I was going to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that moment, fear swallowed me whole. The pain wasn’t just physical — it was the crushing realization that someone I trusted could turn so violent so fast. I felt trapped and powerless, like my whole world had shattered in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      That hotel room became a place of trauma and survival. Every sound, every shadow after that night haunted me. The terror followed me long after I left that room.
    </p>
    <p>
      But surviving that night also marked the beginning of my fight to reclaim my life. It taught me that no one has the right to hurt me, no matter what they say or how close they are. It showed me how important it is to stand up for myself and to demand respect and safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m sharing this because abuse doesn’t always come in neat packages. Sometimes it comes out of nowhere, in moments you never expect. And even if you don’t have a “relationship” with someone, their violence still matters — and your story still matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’ve been through something like this, please know: you’re not alone. You are strong. You are worthy of love that doesn’t hurt. And healing is possible.

    <summary><strong>My Story with Mark</strong></summary>
    <p>
      Mark only let me see his family and friends at the very start of our relationship. After that, I was shut out — isolated, alone, and always left wondering why.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made me feel crazy about his job by never telling me where he was working or sharing his location. Whenever I was overwhelmed or overthinking, instead of reassuring me, he made me feel delusional and like I was losing my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lied to me about his money — how much he was making, where it was going. I needed to know because he never helped with rent or bills, even though he worked 5 to 7 times a week. But instead of honesty, I got accusations for things I never did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark was vile and sexualized me in ways that left me feeling exposed and shamed. He would say things like I was “changing in front of the window so people could see me naked,” or accuse me of “playing with myself” just because my hands were on my lap. He turned every moment into something twisted and uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      He controlled me with words and lies, stripped away my confidence, and made me doubt my own reality. He used my past against me like a weapon, called me names, and made me feel like I was never good enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the end, he took my dogs and her babies — after I poured everything I had into caring for them. I got the mom back but never saw the babies again. I haven’t spoken to him since.
    </p>
    <p>
      I broke free from the fog of control and confusion he wrapped me in. I reclaimed my power and my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you see yourself in my story, know this: You are not crazy. You are not alone. You deserve respect, truth, and freedom.

  <h3>I’m Still Healing</h3>
  <p>I’ve survived things I don’t always talk about. I’ve made it out of rooms I thought I’d die in. I’ve been loved wrong. Left behind. Beaten down and blamed.</p>
  <p>But I’m still here.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Still breathing.</li>
    <li>Still standing.</li>
    <li><strong>Still rising.</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>This story isn’t just mine. It belongs to every woman who’s been told she was crazy, dramatic, or lying. To every girl who stayed too long, ran too late, or never made it out at all.</p>
