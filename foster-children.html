      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve lived through the foster care system. It wasn’t a storybook journey—it was messy, painful, and full of unanswered questions. I was taken into care at 11 years old. The first time, it lasted just 22 days before my Nan got custody of me and my brother. But that wasn’t the end of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were taken away from our Nan and placed in another foster home, and after that, with our other grandparents. It wasn’t stability—it was survival. As a teenager, I was angry, hurting, and lost. I ended up running away to Alberta to be with my boyfriend. His family took me in and gave me a place to stay, which is more than I can say for the system that was supposed to protect me.

      <p class="emphasis">This is not everything. This is not all of it. This is not even half of it.</p>
