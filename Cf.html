    <h2>Cystic Fibrosis</h2>

    <p>Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the lungs and digestive system. It causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the body, leading to respiratory and digestive issues, infections, and other complications. There is no cure â€” but with the right treatment, people with CF are living longer and stronger than ever before.</p>

    <h3>What It's Like Living With CF</h3>
    <p>Living with CF isnâ€™t just about the diagnosis. Itâ€™s about daily routines, hospital visits, medication schedules, treatments, and the emotional weight of a chronic illness. But it's also about strength, determination, and choosing to keep fighting every day. For me, CF shaped who I am â€” not because it defines me, but because Iâ€™ve learned to live beyond it.</p>

    <h3>Quick CF Facts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cystic Fibrosis is caused by a mutation in the CFTR gene.</li>
      <li>Over 4,300 Canadians live with CF.</li>
      <li>People with CF often need enzyme pills to digest food and may do daily physiotherapy and inhaled treatments.</li>
      <li>New medications like Trikafta are changing the game for many people with CF.</li>
      <li>There is no cure â€” yet. Research is ongoing, and advocacy matters.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>My Journey</h3>
    <p>I was diagnosed with CF as a baby, but it didnâ€™t fully hit me until my teenage years. Around 16, I had my first major hospitalization. By 18, they were happening monthly. I started Trikafta in 2021 and it changed everything â€” my breathing, my energy, my hope. But CF is still part of my life. Some days are heavy, but I carry them anyway.</p>

    <h3>How You Can Help</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn about CF and share what you know.</li>
      <li>Support CF Canada or local fundraisers.</li>
      <li>Talk to your local MP about the importance of medication access like Trikafta.</li>
      <li>Be kind â€” not all illness is visible.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>CF may be a part of me, but itâ€™s not the end of my story. ðŸ’œ</p>
