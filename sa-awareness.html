      <p>
        I’ll share my experience here soon. It’s personal. It’s painful. But I know it could help someone else realize they’re not alone.  
        <br><br>
        If you're not ready to read or hear heavy things right now, that’s okay. Come back when you are. Your comfort matters.

      <h2>Facts About Sexual Assault</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 in 3 women and 1 in 6 men experience sexual violence in their lifetime.</li>
        <li>Most sexual assaults are committed by someone the survivor knows.</li>
        <li>Only a fraction of sexual assaults are reported to the police.</li>
        <li>No one ever "asks for it"—clothes, alcohol, or behavior are never consent.</li>
        <li>Consent must be clear, coherent, willing, and ongoing.</li>
      </ul>
